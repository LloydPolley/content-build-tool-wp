Run 'npm install' to install everything to get it working

# Development
Run 'npm run start' for normal development

# Production
Run 'npm run build' to produce the dist folder with all the files needed to copy over to the cms

# Production watch
Run npm run watch - this does the same as "npm run build" but watches it so it updates all the time - will be slowe


# Entry points
Inside src/components/entry.js - this contains all the the files which are being used for the page in development - you can add and remove them here by importing


# Region Selector 
You can change the region inside - src/config/index.js - the target region class adder


# Problems
No Jquery yet
Nested mixins in media queries causing problems
Two Js errors which are always there but don't affect anything
